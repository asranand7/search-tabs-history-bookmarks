    <h1>Privacy Policy for search-tabs-history-bookmarks</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the "search-tabs-history-bookmarks" Chrome extension ('we', 'our', 'us')
        collects, uses, and protects the data from users ('you', 'your') who install and use our extension. The
        extension searches across your open tabs, history, and bookmarks to provide quick and efficient search results.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        We collect data from your Chrome browsing history, open tabs, and bookmarks solely for the purpose of providing
        accurate search results within the extension. This data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted
        to any external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The data accessed by the "search-tabs-history-bookmarks" extension is processed locally on your device. We do not
        store this data on any external servers, nor do we keep it after the search results are provided.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to any third parties. The data accessed by the extension is
        used exclusively to generate search results and remains within your device.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        As the user, you have full control over your browsing data. Since the "search-tabs-history-bookmarks" extension
        does not store or transmit your data externally, you do not need to take any action to protect or delete your data
        beyond managing your Chrome browsing history, tabs, and bookmarks.
    </p>

    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
        We prioritize your privacy and take measures to ensure that your data remains secure and is only accessible within
        your device. No external servers are used to process or store your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and it is your
        responsibility to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the extension after any changes constitutes
        your acceptance of the new policy.
    </p>
